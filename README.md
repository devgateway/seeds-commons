## How to setup your project with a git submodule

When configuring your new app / repo, you can select one directory that you want to configure to get content from a submodule.

For this guide, we'll use /src/seeds-commons

### 1. Configure

When configuring your seeds-dashboard app, run the command below.

On the command line:
```
cd src
git submodule add git@github.com:devgateway/seeds-commons.git seeds-commons
```
